Explanation of Each Line:

   1) *.exe, *.out, *.o, etc., are the types of files that result from compiling your C++ code. These files should not be tracked because they are generated from the source code and can be regenerated.
    
2) .vscode/ and .idea/ are folders created by IDEs like Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA, which contain project settings and configurations that are typically not needed in version control.
    
3) Files like *.log, *.swp, and *.swo are temporary or swap files created by editors (e.g., Vim or Emacs).
    
4) .DS_Store is created by macOS Finder to store custom attributes of a directory.
    
5) Thumbs.db is a cache file created by Windows Explorer.
